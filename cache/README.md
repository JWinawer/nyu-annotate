# Local Cache Directory for the Docker Container

This directory contains local cache files that are used by the running docker
container for this project. This file (`README.md`) should not be deleted, but
it is safe to delete any of the other files or subdirectories in this directory
at any time that the docker container isn't running without breaking
anything. The only difference this will make is that the next time you use the
drawing tool, it might have to redownload or regenerate whatever you
deleted. The primary purpose of using this directory is to speed up the display
of images when you return to the tool and look at or edit your previous
annotations.
